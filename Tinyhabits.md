# Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg

## Question 1
BJ Fogg's story about starting with just two push-ups after brushing his teeth demonstrates the power of tiny habits to build significant change.

## Question 2
B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt; simplify the behavior (low ability), ensure high motivation, and use a clear prompt to make forming new habits easier.

## Question 3
Celebrating after completing a habit reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to become a long-term habit by associating positive emotions with the action.

# 1% Better Every Day

## Question 4
The idea of improving by 1% every day emphasizes that small, consistent changes lead to significant long-term results.

# Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Question 5
The book suggests that focusing on becoming the type of person you want to be, rather than just the outcome, is key to effective habit formation.

## Question 6
To make a habit easier, simplify it, adjust your environment, and reduce friction by breaking it into smaller steps.

## Question 7
To make a habit harder, increase the friction by adding obstacles, removing cues, or making the process less convenient.

# Reflection

## Question 8
To do more of a habit, make the cue obvious, pair it with something enjoyable, simplify the process, and reward yourself immediately.

## Question 9
To reduce a habit, make the cue invisible, associate it with negative outcomes, increase the effort required, and remove immediate rewards.
